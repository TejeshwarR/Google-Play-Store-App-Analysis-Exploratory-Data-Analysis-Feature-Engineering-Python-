# Google Play Store App Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering (Python)

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering (FE)** on **Google Play Store application data** using **Python**. The objective is to analyze app characteristics such as ratings, reviews, installs, pricing, and categories to understand factors that influence app popularity and performance.


---

## 🎯 Goal of the Project
The goals of this project are to:
- Analyze Google Play Store app data to identify popularity and performance drivers
- Perform EDA to understand rating, install, and pricing patterns
- Clean and standardize messy real-world app data
- Apply feature engineering to prepare data for advanced analytics or modeling
- Generate insights useful for app developers and product teams

## 📂 Project Files
- Google_Playstore_analysis.ipynb – Python notebook containing EDA and feature engineering
- playstore.csv – Cleaned dataset used for analysis

---

## 🧾 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about mobile applications listed on the Google Play Store, including:
- App Name
- Category
- Rating
- Reviews
- Size
- Installs
- Type (Free / Paid)
- Price
- Content Rating
- Genres

The data reflects common real-world challenges such as missing values, inconsistent formats, and mixed data types.

## 🔄 Procedure / Methodology
The project was executed using the following structured approach:

### 1. Data Understanding & Cleaning
Reviewed dataset structure, handled missing ratings, removed duplicates, and corrected inconsistent formats in installs, price, and size columns.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed distributions and relationships across:
- App ratings and reviews
- Install counts
- Free vs paid apps
- Category-wise app performance

### 3. Feature Engineering
Performed transformations such as:
- Converting installs and price into numeric values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Creating derived features for analysis readiness

### 4. Data Preparation
Ensured all features were structured, clean, and suitable for further modeling or dashboarding.

## 📊 Key Analysis Highlights
- Majority of apps on the Play Store are free
- Apps with ratings between 4.0 and 4.5 dominate the platform
- High install counts do not always guarantee higher ratings
- Certain categories consistently attract more users and installs
- Data cleaning significantly improves analysis reliability

---

## ⭐ Project Highlights
- Real-world EDA using Python
- Handling messy, high-cardinality categorical data
- Feature engineering on numeric and categorical attributes
- Business-focused interpretation of app performance
- Model-ready dataset preparation
- Strong foundation for recommendation or prediction systems

---

## 💡 Key Business Insights
- Free apps dominate the market in terms of installs
- Paid apps do not necessarily achieve higher ratings
- App category plays a major role in user engagement
- Ratings alone are insufficient to judge app success without install context

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Perform sentiment analysis using app reviews
- Build predictive models for app ratings or installs
- Develop a recommendation system based on app features
- Visualize insights using Power BI or Tableau
- Track app performance trends over time
